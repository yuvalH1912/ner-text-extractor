My name is Nora Fischer, and I am contacting you regarding the Content Strategist role at Digital Media Solutions. My skills include SEO, social media marketing, and analytics tools like Google Analytics and SEMrush. I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to your team’s efforts. Please find my resume attached.

Kind regards,
