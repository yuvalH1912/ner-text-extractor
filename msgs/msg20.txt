Hello,

At Central Hospital, I coordinated extensive clinical trials, focusing on data integrity and compliance using SAS and SPSS for statistical analysis. I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Public Health from Columbia University, specializing in epidemiology. My name is Mia Khalid, and I am applying for the Clinical Research Coordinator position at HealthCorp Clinics. My background in public health and data management can enhance your research operations. Please find attached my resume for more information.

Warm regards,
