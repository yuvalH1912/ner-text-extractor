Dear Jordan,

I am Michael Katz and I am interested in the AI Research Scientist role at InnovateAI.

Holding a Doctorate in Artificial Intelligence from Harvard University, my dissertation explored the implications of AI in robotic mobility.
My professional experience includes deploying AI solutions for autonomous vehicle navigation and developing state-of-the-art algorithms for real-time decision-making systems at AutoDrive Solutions.
Additionally, I have published several papers on AI applications in peer-reviewed journals and spoken at international conferences on similar topics.

I am enthusiastic about the possibility of contributing to your cutting-edge projects and would like to discuss my background in more detail.
Attached is my resume for your review.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Kind regards,
Michael Katz
