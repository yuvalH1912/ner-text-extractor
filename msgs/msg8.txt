Dear Ms. Johnson,

I am Lucas Weber, writing to you in regard to the Biomedical Engineer position at MedTech Innovations.

I received a PhD in Biomedical Engineering from Duke University, with my research primarily focused on biomaterials for prosthetics.
In my recent role at HealthTech Solutions, I led the development of a new synthetic material that has been patented for use in joint replacements.
My background also includes extensive work in tissue engineering and medical device prototyping.

I am eager to explore how my research and industry experience can contribute to the pioneering projects at MedTech Innovations.
Enclosed is my resume for your consideration.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Warmest regards,
Lucas Weber
