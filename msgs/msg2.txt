Hi Samantha,

My name is Rachel Levi, and I am contacting you regarding the Data Scientist position advertised on your company’s website.

I have a Master’s degree in Applied Mathematics from Tel Aviv University, specializing in statistical models and algorithmic processes.
Throughout my career, I have implemented predictive models and complex algorithms in high-stakes trading systems and analyzed large datasets to drive strategy at FinCorp Analytics.
Previously, I also engaged in quantitative analysis and model development for various fintech startups.

I am keen to discuss how my analytical skills and my experience with R and Python could help further the goals of your organization.
I have attached my resume and would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this exciting opportunity with you.

Hope to connect soon.

Best wishes,
Rachel Levi
