Hi Ms. Walters,

At Efficient Solutions LLC, I've overseen IT systems upgrades, integrating technologies such as Oracle databases and cloud solutions including AWS and Azure. I graduated with a Master of Information Systems from Stanford University, where I specialized in systems architecture. My name is Jacob Hernandez, and I am expressing my interest in the Systems Analyst position at TechGlobal Corp. My expertise in systems integration and cloud management can significantly benefit your IT department. Enclosed is my resume for your review.

Best regards,
Jacob Hernandez
