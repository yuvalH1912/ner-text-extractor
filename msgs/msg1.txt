Hello Dr. Tamar,

I am Daniel Cohen, and I am writing to express my interest in the Software Development Manager role at TechInnovate.

I earned a PhD in Computer Science from the Technion, focusing on machine learning optimizations for cloud computing environments.
In my recent roles, I've engineered scalable machine learning pipelines and have extensive experience with data-intensive applications, developing robust models for real-time data processing.
At CloudTech Solutions, my team led significant enhancements in system throughput which dramatically improved data handling capabilities.

I am eager to explore how my background in machine learning and my managerial skills can be of value to the innovative projects at TechInnovate.
