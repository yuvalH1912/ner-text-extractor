Hello Dr. Thompson,

In my four years at HighMark Investments, I've developed strong expertise in financial trend analysis and portfolio management using Python, R, and financial modeling tools like QuantLib and pandas. I graduated with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Finance from New York University. My name is Zoe Patel, and I am interested in the Financial Analyst position at Quantum Investments. My skills in statistical analysis and predictive modeling are well-suited to your team's needs. Attached, please find my resume for your consideration.

Best wishes,
Zoe Patel
